# latex-quickboot-template
LaTeX could be daunting the first time you meet it. This repo is a collection of templates that could help you with your first LaTeX document.

## What you will need
- Working locally
    1. You will need [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) which could be installed [here](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). Choose the distribution that corresponds to your operating system!
    2. You can edit LaTeX source code anywhere since it is plain-text based. For your first project, you can just start with your favorite text editor: vim, sublime, atom, et cetra, anyone will do.
- Working with Online tools
    Check [this](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) out for some possible online editors. Online tools usually have builtin compile tools so there is nothing else to do.

## Compile into pdf
I recommend using ```latexmk``` that should come with MacTeX and could be installed on other distros. Check [this](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html) out if your machine have not already installed latexmk.

### Rational and drawbacks of using ```latexmk```
The author discussed this [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/248530/how-sensible-is-it-to-use-latexmk).

- [xelatex](https://github.com/tingfengx/latex-quickboot-template/tree/master/xelatex): This was adapted from the TeXShop XeLaTeX embeded templates. It allows a lot of customizations and allows the typesetting of non-alphabetical languages, such as Chinese.
